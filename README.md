# Save System

To implement an effective saving mechanism for my First-Person Interaction Demo, I developed a sophisticated system capable of seamlessly storing and retrieving data on the user's computer. This system is currently being worked on for another project andÂ is capable of handling substantial amounts of information, encompassing crucial game data such as object positions, rotations, animation statuses, inventory items, and more.
